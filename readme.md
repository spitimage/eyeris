# Eyeris
This is the new home for the Eyeris android (client) project.

## What is Eyeris?
Eyeris is a prototype/demo system that I built back in 2011. I have always __hated__ passwords, so Eyeris was my attempt to try something new and shop the idea around. You can get a basic overview by looking at some old slideware notes [here](https://github.com/spitimage/eyeris/wiki). It's a very ambitious project, and I enjoyed playing around with it. Since then, it has moved from back burner to junk drawer. After nearly forgetting about it, I am now releasing it - _who knows what may happen?_ If there is any interest, I'd be happy to add more documentation or otherwise re-engage.

## Contents
This project contains all the Android client-side application code. It's a typical Android SDK build.

## Credits
Some of the code I used for low-level certificate manipulation was obtained from the google code project [here](http://code.google.com/p/keystoremanager/). As an eventual commiter on that project, I syncronized my changes in both places.

This project also heavily leverages the intents integration of the [zxing project](https://github.com/zxing/zxing).

## The Server
The server side of the Eyeris system can be found [here](https://github.com/spitimage/eyerisserver).
